It contains plants such as bromeliads and orchids plus gingers and aroids from Asia. The character of the vegetation is dominated by the versatile Bromeliaceae pineapple family. Plants from dry lands throughout the world – from Central America to Southern Africa, from Arabia to Madagascar can be found in the Arid House. This has one of the largest collections of cacti and succulents in Britain. The oldest specimen is the Echinocactus grusonnii or barrel cactus at more than 100 years old. The sight of more than 30 hanging baskets in their full glory in the Victorian Corridor is a must for any visitor over summer months. The magnificent Temperate House with its cascading water feature contains plants from warm temperate regions of the world, especially Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Mediterranean.

It was planned to end at Braemar but Queen Victoria was afraid her privacy would be disturbed by ‘hordes of tourists’ at Balmoral. So she bought land along the route to prevent it. This photograph shows the final train at Culter Station in 1966.Ferryhill Junction, next to the park, was temporarily the city’s first station when the railway came to Aberdeen. The Illustrated London News lithograph below shows the opening in 1850. The Deeside line originally began from here and the engine sheds are still visible at the edge of the park. The Ferryhill Railway Heritage Trust was established in 2007 to restore the remaining building and turntable, and transform the location into a working railway heritage site for the north east of Scotland.
